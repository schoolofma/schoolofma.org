This class is for artists, creatives, and designers of all kinds, tinkerers, technologists of all levels, musicians, writers, researchers, and anyone else interested in coming together for community, learning, sharing, encouragement, feedback, opportunities for collaboration, and generous support in these uncertain times.

                    <p>What magic can occur when we come together with a community of like-minded others to explore, play, create, learn, and share at the intersection of art, technology, design, and human connection? We're super thrilled to offer a different kind of opportunity than we've ever run before, a 100-day online program we're calling Learning to Love You More*.</p> 

                    <p>The world is in a state of flux and indeed it is a strange time to be alive. The cracks in the system are being exposed for all to see. At the same time, we are hopeful that change is coming. In many respects it's already begun. So what can we do now to contribute?</p> 

                    <p>We believe there is power in life-long learning, creativity, and connectedness to others. With this program, we're looking for those of you who feel the same, and who like us, want to contribute to making a sustained difference in our own lives and in the lives of others.</p> 

                    <p>This is the program we’ve been dreaming of in which artists, designers, technologists, makers, researchers and the like come together to explore new topics, develop and expand their practice, and wrestle out the courage to begin something new. We will support you in these endeavors while encouraging curiosity, confidence, and the enthusiasm to say something with your work.</p> 

                    <p>How do you express yourself creatively in the world? Are you learning to code, already working with it or other technologies, or do you consider art, design, moving images or the written word your tools of choice? What happens when you combine your creativity with others in a daily practice?</p>  

                    <p>Throughout this program, there will be weekly prompts to inspire your creative output and lead you towards self-reflection and discovery, as well as regular interactions with others doing the same.</p>  

                    <p> Once the program begins you will be assigned a classroom for instant connection and a mentor who will be available for one-on-one check-ins if you feel stuck. Additionally, we will invite guest speakers to monthly live-calls to speak on topics relating to art, technology, and society, with questions, interaction and discussion following.</p> 

                    <p>There will be opportunities to take part in short readings, and discussion groups to help you unpack them with others. In time everyone will be encouraged to play, remix, connect, share skills, and learn new ones. That said, there are no requirements or expertise necessary--openness, generosity and curiosity are all you need. We invite you to come as you are!</p> 

                    <p>As usual, we are setting tuition for this program at an absolute minimum in an effort towards radical inclusivity. We would love to contribute to a better world in our lifetime and we believe this begins with helping to raise the voices of those under-represented. Therefore, for this program we are experimenting with a new fee structure in which for each person who joins our program at the set fee, we will offer a full scholarship to someone from an under-represented community in the tech field, with preference given to 1) black, indigenous, and other people of color; and 2) provided you have limited financial means, women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people, as well as individuals from non-western countries.</p> 

                    <p>This class is for those of you who are ready to come together to become your most creative, generous self while exploring new tools, technologies, and ideas with others in consideration of the current context in which we live. Come join us!</p>

<p>In this first section of the program, prompts will focus on self. The idea is to encourage us to look within and to express what we find creatively through our daily practice.<br>

</p>

                        </p>

                            <p><b>Section 2: Others</b><br>

<p>In this second section of the program, prompts will focus on others. Who are the people you are sharing space with? What are they creating, how and why? Where are the differences and similarities between different individuals and their creative practices? </p>

                        </p>
                                                <p>
                            <p><b>Section 3: Community</b><br>

<p>In this third section of the program, prompts will focus on community. Here we encourage you to connect with like-minds, to share and remix works, to find the links between yourself and others, to experiment with collaboration.</p>

                        </p>
                                                <p>
                            <p><b>Section 4: Society</b><br>&nbsp;

<p>In this fourth section of the program, prompts will be focused on society. By now, you've taken into consideration who you are and who others are and the impacts we all have on each other's lives. Now we ask you to create works that reflect what's going on around us and the world we live in. How could things be different? Better?</p>

</p>

<p><b>Section 5: Creative Output</b><br>

<p>This final section of the program is focused on your creative output. Take what you've learned and the dots you've connected a step further. What does the creative expression you want to see put out into the world look like?</p>

</p>

<p><b>Section 6: Documentation</b><br>

<p>As we begin to wrap up this program, we will spend some time focused on documentation. In the future, when we look back at our time together or speak about our experience with others, the question may arise: wow, what just happened? In this moment we take time to honor our inquisitive future selves.</p>

<p>Over the past 15+ years she’s lived in and organized social justice and tech communities and events big and small. She feels compelled to help bring these two worlds together and make the tech world less daunting and more diverse, inclusive, thoughtful, and fun.</p>

<p>Rachel's biggest desire is to see people living the lives they dream of living rather than the one they feel they ought to. If that dream life is more artistic, creative, socially-engaged, technology-embracing and connects humans to each other and to themselves, well, all the better.</p>
